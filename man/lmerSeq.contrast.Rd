\title{Function to summarize individual linear contrasts coefficients}
\usage{
lmerSeq.contrast(lmerSeq_results = NULL, contrast_mat = NULL,
  p_adj_method = "BH", ddf = "Satterthwaite", sort_results = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{lmerSeq_results}{Results object from running lmerSeq.fit}

\item{contrast_mat}{Numeric matrix representing the contrast to be tested.  Matrix must have the same number of columns as the number of coefficients in the model.  If the matrix has multiple rows, a simultaneous F-test will be done}

\item{p_adj_method}{Method for adjusting for multiple comparisons (default is Benjamini-Hochberg). See p.adjust.methods}

\item{ddf}{Method for computing degrees of freedom and t-statistics. Options are "Satterthwaite" and "Kenward-Roger"}

\item{sort_results}{Should the results table be sorted by adjusted p-value?}
}
\description{
Conducts t- or F-tests on linear contrasts of regression coefficients from fits done using lmerSeq_fit function.  If the contrast matrix has only 1 row, a t-test is done.  If the contrast matrix has more than 1 row, an F-test is done
